# Grbl_Stm32
based on Grbl atmega version converted to Kit Nucleo-H743ZI2, maximum pulse output speed of 300Khz for 8 axes with integrated Backlash and maximum expansion limit to 8 axes, additional rapid override feature 75%, I will continue to develop more MPG encoder, add nodes if there is time, there is an error now when I push the chasing frequency to 400kHz, although I have fixed some bugs when the shafts have servos. has too large frequency and quite a long stretch, where the float cannot show all the digits after the floating point instead of a double which distorts the profile, if you read and like, you can donate via Visa card,Support me a couple of 🍻!
